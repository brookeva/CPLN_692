        <h2>48 Hours in Lisbon!</h2>
        <p>We honestly think we covered the best that Lisbon has to offer in this film. 
          <br>
          <br>From traditional Portuguese food, to a tiny 7-seat sushi bar, natural wine to piri chicken we loved every second of this trip. 
          <br>
          <br>Go to these places and tell them TOPJAW sent you! With costs everywhere going ballistic, Lisbon was refreshingly low cost and great value everywhere we went. 
          <br>
          <br>We cannot recommend it enough!

        <h2>Bonjardim</h2>
        <p>Tucked along a small side street, Bonjardim makes its home in an unassuming building in an unassuming corner of a city full of restaurants with staff begging you to come eat with them. No one will chase you down the street with fliers trying to bring you to Bonjardim, but then again, why should they, the smell of the food takes care of that for them. 
          <br>
          <br>Despite their seeming lack of initiative, from the moment you seat yourself (as is common practice for outdoor dining in Lisbon) the staff at Bonjardim is ready for you. Service is attentive but not overbearing, but the real experience starts when you receive your food.</p>
